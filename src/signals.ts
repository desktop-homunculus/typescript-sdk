/**
 * Signals API namespace for cross-process communication.
 *
 * Provides a pub/sub mechanism that allows external processes to communicate
 * with the Desktop Homunculus application and its mods through event streaming.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Real-time event streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
 * - Signal broadcasting to multiple subscribers
 * - Type-safe payload handling
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Listen for custom events from external processes
 * const eventSource = signals.stream<{action: string, data: any}>(
 *   "my-custom-signal",
 *   (payload) => {
 *     console.log("Received signal:", payload.action, payload.data);
 *   }
 * );
 *
 * // Send signals to all listeners
 * await signals.send("my-custom-signal", {
 *   action: "update",
 *   data: { message: "Hello from external app!" }
 * });
 *
 * // Clean up when done
 * eventSource.close();
 * ```
